# SQL Challenge
The database contains two tables, store_revenue and marketing_data. Refer to the two CSV files, store_revenue and marketing_data to understand how these tables have been created.

store_revenue contains revenue by date, brand ID, and location:

> create table store_revenue ( id int not null primary key auto_increment, date datetime, brand_id int, store_location varchar(250), revenue float);

marketing_data contains ad impression and click data by date and location:

> create table marketing_data ( id int not null primary key auto_increment, date datetime, geo varchar(2), impressions float, clicks float );

### Please provide a SQL statement under each question.

- Question #0 (Already done for you as an example) Select the first 2 rows from the marketing data​
> select * from marketing_data limit 2;​

- Question #1 Generate a query to get the sum of the clicks of the marketing data​
- Question #2 Generate a query to gather the sum of revenue by store_location from the store_revenue table​
- Question #3 Merge these two datasets so we can see impressions, clicks, and revenue together by date and geo. Please ensure all records from each table are accounted for.
- Question #4 In your opinion, what is the most efficient store and why?​
- Question #5 (Challenge) Generate a query to rank in order the top 10 revenue producing states​
